This program replicates the game 'MASTERMIND', but where in the original game colors are chosen for 4 separate positions. Instead the codebreaker in this game chooses digits for 4 separate positions. You are able to choose whether to be the CodeMaker or CodeBreaker at the beginning of program runtime. The computer has been optimized to choose the most likely digits depending upon feedback given after each turn. The CodeBreaker has 12 turns in order to figure out the digit combination. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game) for more information on how the game is played.
